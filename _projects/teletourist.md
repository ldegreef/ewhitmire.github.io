  People can have experiences through video calls that are otherwise inaccessible. For example, someone who cannot leave the home may wish to experience visiting the zoo. We present TeleTourist, a system that uses video calls with strangers to share experiences for people with mobility restrictions. We designed TeleTourist to enhance immersion and personalization, as well as help balance the relationship between participants of the video calls. We discuss features we have implemented or envisioned for TeleTourist, as well as attributes we wish to evaluate in future work.

blurb: |-
  During an internship at Microsoft Reserach, I conceived and developed a prototype of TeleTourist, a system that uses video calls with strangers to share experiences for people with mobility restrictions. I interviewed individuals with mobility restrictions as formative work, designed system features, and implemented a subset of them for a prototype. This project was published as a poster at CSCW '16 and resulted in a patent.
