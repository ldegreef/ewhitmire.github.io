  People can have experiences through video calls that are otherwise inaccessible. For example, someone who cannot leave the home may wish to experience visiting the zoo. We present TeleTourist, a system that uses video calls with strangers to share experiences for people with mobility restrictions. We designed TeleTourist to enhance immersion and personalization, as well as help balance the relationship between participants of the video calls. We discuss features we have implemented or envisioned for TeleTourist, as well as attributes we wish to evaluate in future work.

blurb: |-
  During an internship at Microsoft Reserach, I created TeleTourist — a system that uses video calls with strangers to share experiences for people with mobility restrictions. I began the development of features for the system to enhance immersion and personalization, as well as help balance the relationship between participants of the video calls. This project was published in a poster at CSCW '16.
