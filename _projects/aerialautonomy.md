  This work presents a combination of software and hardware that makes aerial autonomy substantially more accessible both in terms of programmatic complexity and in terms of cost. We use the ARDrone quadrotor helicopter and Willow Garage's Robot Operating System software infrastructure to demonstrate several autonomous tasks. Using vision as the sole aerial sensor, we demonstrate point-to-point navigation, aerial support of a ground robots, and robot localization within image-based maps. In contrasting several variations of SURF- feature matching, we demonstrate that low-cost aerial platforms can support robust, landmark-free visual spatial reasoning. This evaluation shows that aerial platforms can be practical, cost- and time-effective components of task-performing systems. We argue that aerial autonomy should be considered a broadly accessible resource, within reach of any investigator or educator of AI robotics.

blurb: |-
   I created and explored vision-based localization algorithms for aerial robots as part of a team of five students. We prototyped autonomous cooperation between ground-based and airborne robots and demonstrated localization for a quadrotor helicopter toy using only a built-in camera. We presented our work as demos at GCER '11 and AAAI '11, a talk at CWIC '12, and a publication in TePRA '12.
