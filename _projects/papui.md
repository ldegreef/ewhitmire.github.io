abstract: |-
  Instructions at workstations (such as stations for packaging boxes, preparing food, or other manual tasks) are often displayed relatively small and off to the side from the station's workflow. Projecting instructions directly onto the table- or counter-top in concert with monitoring from an RGB-D camera can enable alternative ways to offer instruction. Within this space, I investigated the potential inclusion of eyes- and head-tracking. I came up with perspective-aware user interface tools enabled by head-tracking, and combined concepts from computer graphics with HCI to produce several prototypes and demonstrated the system in its real-world, intended environment.

blurb: |-
  During an internship at Amazon I designed, developed, and evaluated eyes and head tracking related user interface elements to use in enhanced reality interfaces in fulfillment centers. I combined concepts from computer graphics with HCI to produce several prototypes and demonstrated the system in its intended environment. This work resulted in a patent.
