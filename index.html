                    I am a graduating computer science PhD candidate at the <a href="http://cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> with an NSF fellowship and Microsoft Research PhD fellowship, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak">Shwetak Patel</a> in the <a href="http://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu">Ubiquitous Computing Lab</a>. Within the broad spectrum of ubiquitous computing, my interests include computer vision, embedded systems, machine learning, HCI, and mHealth. My research focuses on integrating HCI, ML, and computer vision to improve access to medical care with low-cost commodity hardware and mobile phones. Outcomes of my work are under active commercial development and have already begun to change medical standards of care.
